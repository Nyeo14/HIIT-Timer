# HIIT-Timer
Simple timer I made to time my workouts since I can't find another one. This timer is specifically for high-intensity interval training. If you don't know what that is, it's a workout method where you work out with short bursts of high intensity exercise then rest for a short amount of time.

A common example would be 3 sets of 6 exercises. For each set, you do one exercise for 45 seconds, then rest for 15 seconds. Then do the next exercise for 45 seconds, then rest for 15 seconds. And so on. 

Users are able to choose: number of sets, number of exercises per set, exercise interval duration, rest duration, and rest between sets duration. The default values are 3 sets, 6 exercises per set (45sec each), 15 second rest periods, and 20 second rest between each set.
